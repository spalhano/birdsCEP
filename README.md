# birdsCEP

Pipeline workflow for working with UCE data with historical DNA. This is an adaptation, compiling "parts" of pipelines from Phyluce (Faircloth), Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz√¥nia - INPA (Andermann, Buainain), incluiding an experimental alternative developed from Museu Nacional - MN (Palhano/Weksler) for cleaning missing data and high contaminated sites from birds toepads samples (historical DNA).
